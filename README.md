# BuiltbyAI-Rust

## Core Concept of BuiltByAI
A Rust library that enables AI projects to:

Securely log data and results: Immutable storage of AI processing results for auditability and compliance.
Facilitate payments for API usage: Decentralized micropayments for AI services.
Verify provenance of AI models and data: Certification of AI tools, datasets, and results.
Enable decentralized AI execution: Distribution and coordination of AI workloads on-chain.

### Key Features

#### 1. Immutable Logging and Provenance Tracking

Use Case: Record every AI model's output, decisions, or process steps on the blockchain for transparency and accountability.
Implementation:
Transaction-based Logs: Write logs as transactions on the Solana blockchain.
Metadata Storage: Use Solana’s accounts or decentralized storage (e.g., Arweave/IPFS) for larger data.
Library Components:
log_to_blockchain(key: &str, value: &str):
Logs key-value pairs on the Solana blockchain.
Example: Log an inference result or model metadata.


#### 2. Payment Integration for AI Services

Use Case: Automate payments for AI services, such as API calls or model licensing.
Implementation:
SOL or SPL Tokens: Enable payments with Solana’s native SOL token or a custom SPL token.
Escrow Contracts: Use smart contracts to escrow payments until results are delivered.
Library Components:
initialize_payment(amount: u64, recipient: &str):
Automates payment transactions.
release_payment(tx_id: &str):
Releases funds after job completion.

#### 3. Model and Data Certification

Use Case: Verify that an AI model or dataset is authentic and has not been tampered with.
Implementation:
Hashing: Generate hashes for models and datasets, storing them on-chain.
Ownership Proofs: Use Solana accounts to track ownership or contributors.
Library Components:
store_model_hash(model_path: &str):
Hashes the file and records it on-chain.
verify_model_hash(model_path: &str, hash: &str):
Checks whether the hash matches the recorded blockchain entry.

#### 4. Decentralized AI Execution Coordination

Use Case: Coordinate decentralized AI workloads (e.g., Federated Learning or edge AI tasks).
Implementation:
Task Distribution: Use smart contracts to assign tasks to nodes.
Result Aggregation: Combine results from decentralized execution.
Library Components:
register_task(task_details: &TaskDetails):
Registers a task on-chain.
submit_result(task_id: &str, result: &str):
Submits results to the blockchain for aggregation.
