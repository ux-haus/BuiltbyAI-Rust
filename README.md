## 🚀 Core Features

1. **Immutable Logging and Provenance Tracking**  
   - Record AI processing results, decisions, and model metadata securely on the blockchain.
   - Ensure transparency and accountability with tamper-proof logs.

2. **Payment Integration for AI Services**  
   - Automate micropayments for API usage and licensing using SOL or SPL tokens.
   - Implement escrow-based payment mechanisms for trustless transactions.

3. **Model and Data Certification**  
   - Certify the authenticity of AI models and datasets by storing cryptographic hashes on-chain.
   - Verify the provenance of models to ensure reliability and reproducibility.

4. **Decentralized AI Execution Coordination**  
   - Distribute AI workloads to multiple nodes using blockchain-based task registration and result aggregation.
   - Enable federated learning and collaborative AI development with blockchain governance.
